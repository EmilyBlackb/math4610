### Code to Determine Machine Precision

It is always a good idea to understand the precision with which any real number can be represented. To do this, one can write a
very little bit of computer code that will test to see how close one can get to the number 1 before precision is lost. An example
code is included in this appendix. The code is in Fortran, but can easily be translated into a C/C++, Python, or Java code. The
main reason for including the code is to make sure students get started very quickly in writing and using codes.
