  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write a routine that will perform Gaussian elimination on a square matrix. Return the result of the operation
      in the input array. That is, overwrite the orginal array with the elimination.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the work in the previous problem but for a general rectangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform forward substitution on a square lower triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform back substitution on a square upper triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Combine the routines from the previous problems to form a routine to solve square linear systems of equations.
      That is, reuse the routines you have already created through instantiation, calling with arguments, etc. Download the

    <li> Problem: Create a new routine from your Gaussian Elimination routine that saves the multiplication factors and contains
      the information for a LU-factorization of a square matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Combine routines from previous problems in this homework set to solve a square linear system of equations using
      LU-factorization.

    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
