    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 4 Problems - Due
  </h1>
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write a routine that will perform Gaussian elimination on a square matrix. Return the result of the operation
      in the input array. That is, overwrite the orginal array with the elimination.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the work in the previous problem but for a general rectangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform forward substitution on a lower triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform back substitution on an upper triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Combine the routines from the previous problems to form a routine to solve square linear systems of equations.
      That is, reuse the routines you have already created through instantiation, calling with arguments, etc.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Create a new routine from your Gaussian Elimination routine that saves the multiplication factors and contains
      the information for a LU-factorization of a square matrix.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Combine routines from previous problems in this homework set to solve a square linear system of equations using
      LU-factorization.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
         $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
      Write a routine that will return the roots of a quadratic polynomial in an array. Also, create a software manual entry for
      the routine and include this in your software manual.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Compute the solutions for the following simple initial value problems:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=3 x$ and $x(0)=1.0$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=3 t x$ and $x(0)=1.0$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=4$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=400$ </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Search the internet for an application that is influenced by machine precision. Write a paragraph on one of
      the results you have found. Identify one and only one such web site. Make sure that you cite the web site appropriately.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Graph the solutions of the last two differential equations in the Problem above. That is,
      <ol type="a">
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=4$ </li>
        <li> ${{dx}\over{dt}}=0.1 x - 0.003 x^2$ and $x(0)=400$ </li>
      </ol>
      You do not need to recompute the solutions - just graph the solutions.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
    </li>
  </ol>
