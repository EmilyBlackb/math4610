    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 1 Problems
  </h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <p> Problem: Write a code that will return the machine precision for your computer (or any other computer). Give the
          method a name that is descriptive - for example, maceps(), or something like that. The routine should return the default
          machine precision. Create a second routine that will return the machine precision in double the precision. Give the
          routine a unique name, say dmaceps(). Make sure that your code is fully documented with you as the author and so on. An
          example of a Fortran code is given in the notes. You can translate this into a C or C++ code to do the work.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Problem: Create software manual pages for the two routines using the template at the following link:

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Problem: To complete this problem, you may need to go to the Engineering Computer Lab on the third floor of the
         Engineering Building. If you have Cygwin installed on a laptop or desktop computer that you own, you can do this
         homework at home. Note that if you have some version of Linux/Unix on your computer, you can also do this homework
         using your own computer. Finally, if you are working on a MAC/Apple, you can also complete this problem using your
         laptop or desktop. Complete the following steps:
         <ol type="a">
           <li> Log onto the computer (Engineering Lab) and open a command terminal to work in. </li>
           <li> Upload the routines that you created in the first problem. </li>
           <li> 
             Compile the routines into object modules (.o files). For example, put the files you have uploaded into a
             folder, say hw1_prob3, using the command
             <pre>
               % mkdir hw1_prob3
             </pre>
             in a Cygwin/Linux/Unix operating system. Then use
             <pre>
               % mv *.f hw1_prob3
               % cd hw1_prob3
             </pre>
             to move all files ending with a .f suffix to the folder just created and change the current folder to the folder
             just created. Finally, compile the files using
             <pre>
               % gfortran -c *.f
             </pre>
             or
             <pre>
               % gcc -c *.o
             </pre>
             using a C-compiler. The result will be a bunch of object files with a suffix of ".o".
           </li>
           <li>
             The last step in this problem is to create a shared library from the routines you have created.      
             <pre>
               % ar rcv mylib *.o
             </pre>
             or  
             <pre>
               % ar rcv mylib *.o
               % ranlib mylib.a
             </pre>
           </li>
         </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> Problem: In this problem you will learn a bit more about your computer and how many processes you can run on the cores
         included in your computer. You will use OpenMP to do this work. To start, write code like the following.
         <pre>
           program main
           print *, "hello world"
           stop
           end
         </pre>      
      


      
         to implement the good old Hello World introductory program. Compile and run the code you have created. The code should
         produce the string in the print statement.
    </li>
    <li>
      When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
         $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
    </li>
