    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 3 Problems - Due
  </h1>
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute and return the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms (lengths) of a given
      vector of arbitrary length. The routines should use as input, a vector and the length of the input vector and output
      a double value that is the length of the vector. Add the three routines to your software library.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute the absolute and relative errors in the approximation of one vector
      and the "exact" vector. The routines should take as input two vectors, $x$ and $y$, and the length of the two vectors.
      The output should be a single double value that represents the error. Note that there are six total routines that need
      to be developed - three for the absolute error and three for the relative error. The three routines should compute the
      errors in the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms as defined in the previous problem.

    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement Newton's method.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement the secant method approximation of Newton's
      method.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement a hybrid method using bisection to guarantee
      the roots are bracketed and Newton's method for faster convergence once the interval has been narrowed. Make sure that
      the bisection method reduces the interval size by one order of magnitude ($10^{-1}$) when the method is necessary. Then
      try one step of Newton's method to see if the interval has been reduced enough.

    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
