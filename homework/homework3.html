    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 3 Problems - Due
  </h1>
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute and return the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms (lengths) of a given
      vector of arbitrary length. The routines should use as input, a vector and the length of the input vector and output
      a double value that is the length of the vector. Add the three routines to your software library.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute the absolute and relative errors in the approximation of one vector
      and the "exact" vector. The routines should take as input two vectors, $x$ and $y$, and the length of the two vectors.
      The output should be a single double value that represents the error. Note that there are six total routines that need
      to be developed - three for the absolute error and three for the relative error. The three routines should compute the
      errors in the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms as defined in the previous problem.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines for each of the following vector operations
      <ol type="a">
        <li> vector addition </li>
        <li> vector subtraction </li>
        <li> multiplying a scalar into a vector </li>
        <li> the inner product of two vectors of the same length </li>
        <li> the cross product of two vectors of the same length </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual to cover these routines.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines to compute the Frobenius, $l_1$, and $l_\infty$ norms of a matrix. Add entries to
      your software manual for these routines.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines for each of the following matrix operations. 
      <ol type="a">
        <li> matrix addition </li>
        <li> matrix subtraction </li>
        <li> transpose a matrix </li>
        <li> traace of a matrix </li>
        <li> multiplying a scalar into a matrix </li>
        <li> multiplication of a matrix into a vector </li>
        <li> multiplication of two matrices </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual for each of the routines you write.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines for the following additional matrix operations. 
      <ol type="a">
        <li> the outer product of two matrices </li>
        <li> the Kronecker product of two matrices </li>
        <li> determinant of a matrix </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual for each of the routines you write.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that take advantage of parallel/concurrent computing to perform the following matrix
      operations.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> the product of a matrix and vector </li>
        <li> the product of two matrices </li>
        <li> the </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Problem: 
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Internet Search 1
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
