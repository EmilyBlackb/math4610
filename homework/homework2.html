    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 2 Problems - Due
  </h1>
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write routines that can be used to compute the absolute and relative error of a machine precision number
      and an "exact" value. The output should be a single number of type double. Note that you should be considering the
      efficiency of the routines you write. So, do not use branching statements to write one routine to implement these types
      of algorithms in a single routine. Conditional statements should be avoided in terms of efficiency. Add the routines to
      the software manual you are building throughout the semester and add the routines to your shared libraries.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: In this problem, you will investigate problems that occur due to finite precision of arithmetic. In the text,
      one standard approximation for derivatives involves the definition
      $$\int\ f(x)\ dx = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\ {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
      The approximation
      $$\int\ f(x)\ dx \approx {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
      is used in many application. For example, in the numerical solution of differential equations, the approximation above is
      used quite often. Write code that implements this approximation for various values of the paramter $h$. Use the routine
      you create, along with the code for the relative and absolute error, to investigate this approximation as $h$ tends to
      zero. Graph the results starting with $h=1$ and then dividing $h$ by two until the approximation fails to get better.
      Hint: Use any function you want from calculus. In fact, it would be best to try a couple of different functions. Add a
      summary of your work in your software manual as an example of the importance of absolute and relative errors in machine
      precision computations.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Sometimes a formula can be modified to mitigate issues related to machine precision computations.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Above, an approximation of the derivative. For $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ use the derivative approximation using to examine
          machine precision errors as $h$ tends to zero. Then use the conjugate of the numerator to rewrite the derivative formula
          using the following steps:
          <ol type="i">
            <li> multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate, </li>
            <li> simplify the expression, and </li>
            <li> analyze the errors using the new form of the derivative. </li>
          </ol>
          Compare the result with the direct use of the derivative formula.
        </li>
        <li> In this problem, approximate the derivative of $f(x)=sin(x)$ at $x_0=0$ using the difference
          $$\int\ f(x)\ dx \approx {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
          and use a Taylor series expansion in place of the evaluation of the sine function. Recall that $sin(0)=0$. Rewrite
          the expression and make sure the derivative is accurately approximated as $h$ is taken closer to zero. What is the
          computational difference between the initial expression and the rewritten expression?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Problem: For this problem, you will need to write a routine (or possibly more than one routine) that searches for a
      root of a given function using function iteration. Recall from your reading, you will need to provide an iteration
      function in each case. Apply functional iteration to each of the problems given below:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> $f(x)=x^2-3$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=sin(\pi\ x)$ </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Problem: bisection method problem
    </li>
    <li> Problem: newton method problem
    </li>
    <li> Problem: secant method problem
    </li>
    <li> Problem: hybrid method problem
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Internet search problem.
