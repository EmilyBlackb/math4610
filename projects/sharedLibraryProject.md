## Project: How To Build A Shared Library

The code you write as you work through the homework for approximately solving mathematical problems should be reusable. At
least you should make a strong effort to make your code reusable. Once the code you write is debugged and can be used in
other applications, it makes sense that the code be put into a repository or some other form that allows repeated access to
the codes.

### Building a Shared Library for Unix/Linux Environments

In this section students will put together a shared library using the Unix/Linux archive utility the command that we will use
in a bash/csh shell is:

    ar()

with appropriate flags specified for various coding languages and options. Most of the material used to create this part of the
project can be found at the site:

    http://cygwin.org

As an example of how one can create a script that automatically creates a shared library, the author implemented the ar command
in the following script for creating any number of shared libraries.





### Dynamic Linked Library (DLL) Instructions

The information in this part of the project involves the creation of a Dynamic Linked Library (DLL) for use with codes written
on Microsoft Windows computers. You should use this to create your own DLLs for this course with the code written throughout
the semester. Most of the material for this project can be accessed by clicking on the following link.

So, let's start the process of building a DLL.
