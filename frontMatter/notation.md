## Mathematical Concepts and Notation for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

This section presents mathematical notation that will be used through out the repository/book. It is important to have some type
of agreement on how to represent the mathematics we will use in the development of the mathematical problems and algorithms for
the approximate solution of the mathemtical problems we encounter.

### Taylor/Power Series

### Matrix Notation and Matrix Algebra

### Differential Equation Notation
