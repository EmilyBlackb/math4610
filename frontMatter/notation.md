## Mathematical Concepts and Notation for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

This section presents mathematical notation that will be used through out the repository/book. It is important to have some type
of agreement on how to represent the mathematics we will use in the development of the mathematical problems and algorithms for
the approximate solution of the mathemtical problems we encounter. The content in this section provides an extremely brief review
of some topics from algebra. The review is only on notation and analytic methods for solving mathematical problems needed in this
book.

### Algebra and Trigonometry Notation

### Calculus Notation

### Taylor/Power Series

Since Taylor series appear frequently in the analysis of algorithms, this part of calculus is presented in its own section. The
starting point for the development of Taylor series is to consider the representation of an elementary function as a polynomial of
(possibly) inifinite degree.

### Matrix Notation and Matrix Algebra

### Differential Equation Notation

### Code Blocks

Github allows users to include code blocks in a variety of programming languages. Code blocks will appear as follow. When you
encounter a code block, you will be able to cut an paste code into text files. This will allow you to get code running easily.
A lot of the Exercises in this repository will require that you modify example codes which will require getting the example
codes to work correctly.
