## Preface for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

The content in this repository is a work in progress at Utah State University (USU). There will be (are) several contributors to this
work. First the students in this course have taught the author more and better computing tricks. This is due to the fact that
students tend to keep up on new and better computational toys than one aging professor. The author has learned and forgotten
enumerable coding languages and tricks over a number decades. It is expected that other instructors of Math 4610 at Utah State
University will embrace this material. The expectation is that this repository will evolve into a set of freely available materials 
that students can use during the course and after completing the course for as long as this repository is maintained and/or Github
continues to be so darned easy to use.

The initial version of this repository was created and maintained by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe). The author
has over 35 years of experience writing code for simulation of black oil reservoirs with an internship with Chevron Oil Field
Research Company (when it was called that) to Fishery Simulators written in Java for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)
in Seattle, WA. Many of the projects in the repository have been studied and worked on by the author.

All are welcome to use this repository for learning and teaching topics commonly used in computational mathematics. There are
loads of algorithms and other computational ideas that have and will be included in this repository. Some of the material is based
on current hardware and software. As things change it is hoped that the material in the repository will keep up with newer methods
and technologies.

If you find errors in the materials or typos, please send e-mail to the author at joe.koebbe@usu.edu. I will try to get to the
comments and errors as fast as I can take care of them. In other words, be a bit patient with corrections.

Mathematics in this repository is displayed using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) and regular html files
that contain bits of mathematics embedded in the html. For example, click on the following link to see what this might look like
in a web page: [MathJax Test](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/frontMatter/mathjaxTest.html). Also, graphics displayed in the
text are in GIF image files/format. A test case for this is available at this link:
