**Contact Comments:** You can contact your instructor in a number of ways. Email is, by far, the most reliable method of
contacting your instructor. If you call the number above, you may end up on the campus voicemail system. Note that messages on
the campus phone system are also forwarded to instructor email accounts with (possibly) a text translation. You should get used
to using the contact information above to set up appointments outside office hours and to ask questions about content in the
course.

### General Comments/Policies for Math 4610:

This course covers the development and implementation of fundamental algorithms in computational mathematics. The methods
and algorithms presented in the course are not in and of themselves used to approximately solve complicated mathematical 
problems. The algorithms comprise building blocks for complex algorithms that can be used to approximate many mathematical
and physical systems. The algorithms that will be covered include basic root nding methods, direct methods for approximate 
solution of linear systems of equations, matrix operations, eigenvalue and eigenvector computations, polynomial interpolation, 
numerical dierentiation formulas, numerical integration formulas, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), along with other concepts 
related to computational mathematics. The lion's share of the work in this course will involve the implementation of algorithms 
using some higher level language (C, C++, Python, Fortran, Java, etc.) along with some analysis. Students will need to know how 
to apply theorems from a standard calculus course. The theorems will be presented without proof in this course. The main 
analytic tools you will need to use throughout the course are Taylor series, results from linear algebra related to row 
reduction, and results for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations. It will be understandable if you do not quite remember 
everything when these results are presented. However, you should be able to review the topics from calculus, linear algebra, and 
other courses when needed. If, in the end, you are still having problems understanding the basic theorems, it will be important 
for you to talk over the theorems used in the class with me.
