## Preface for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

The content in this repository is a work in progress at Utah State University. There will be (are) several contributors to this
work. First the students in this course help teach the author more and better computing tricks. This is due to the fact that
students tend to keep up on new and better computational toys than one aging professor. In addtion, it is expected that other
instructors of Math 4610 at Utah State University will embrace this material. The expectation is to create a set of freely
available materials students can use during the course and after completing the course for as long as this repository is
maintained or Github continues to be so darned easy to use.

The initial version of this repository was created and maintained by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe). The author
has over 35 years of experience writing code for simulation of black oil reservoirs with an internship with Chevron Oil Field
Research Company (when it was called that) to Fishery Simulators written in Java for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)
in Seattle, WA.

All are welcome to use this repository for learning an teaching topics commonly used in computational mathematics. There are
loads of algorithms and other computational ideas. Some of the material is based on current hardware and software. As things
change it is hoped that the material in the repository will keep up with newer methods and technologies.

If you find errors in the materials or typos, please send e-mail to the author at joe.koebbe@usu.edu. I will try to get to the
comments and errors as fast as I can take care of them. In other words, be a bit patient with corrections.

Mathematics in this repository is displayed using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) and regular html files
that contain bits of mathematics embedded in the html. For example, click on the following link to see what this might look like
in a web page: [MathJax Test](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/chapter00/mathjaxTest.html). Also, graphics displayed in the text 
are in GIF image files/format. A test case for this is available at this link:
