## Preface for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

The content in this repository is a work in progress at Utah State University. There will be (are) several contributors to this
work. First the students in this course help teach the author more and better computing tricks. This is due to the fact that
students tend to keep up on new and better computational toys than one aging professor. In addtion, it is expected that other
instructors of Math 4610 at Utah State University will embrace this material. The expectation is to create a set of freely
available materials students can use during the course and after completing the course for as long as this repository is
maintained or Github continues to be so darned easy to use.

The initial version of this repository was created and maintained by [Joe Koebbe]
