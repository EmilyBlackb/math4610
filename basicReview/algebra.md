## Algebra Review and Notation

### Definition of Relations and Functions

### Inverse Functions

### Implicit versus Explicit Relationships

In basic algebra courses

Example: Newton's Method

### Algebraic Operations

It may seem a bit trivial for this review to include basic binary operations. However, later in this text, the use of binary
operations must be done with care in some circumstances. Due to finite precision of arithmetic when computers, graphing
calculators, and any other digital device, errors will be generated when numerical operations are applied.

#### Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

As a starting point, we should define sets of numbers that will be used in this text. There are several sets of numbers that
are important in this course. First, the set of natural numbers is important in developing algorithms that require iterations
in a basic computation. For example, Newton's method requires a loop over computing linear approximations to roots of nonlinear
functions. One formula for the application of Newton's method is:

Note that the subscript, k, is chosen to be in the sequence of natural numbers, k=1, 2, 3, ...
