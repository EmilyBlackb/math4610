### Definition of Relations and Functions

### Inverse Functions

### Implicit versus Explicit Relationships

In basic algebra courses

Example: Newton's Method

### Algebraic Operations

It may seem a bit trivial for this review to include basic binary operations. However, later in this text, the use of binary
operations must be done with care in some circumstances. Due to finite precision of arithmetic when computers, graphing
calculators, and any other digital device, errors will be generated when numerical operations are applied.
