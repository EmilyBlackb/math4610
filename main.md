[Course Syllabus](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus.pdf): This is a pdf file that contains a current incarnation
of the syllabus for the course.

## Introduction to the Course

This course presents content related to basic scientific computing problems. Students are asked to (1) implement algorithms
from a basic numerical methods course (e.g, Newton's method for finding roots), (2) use techniques from calculus, linear
algebra, and differential equations to do basic analysis of errors (e.g, Taylor series expansion), and (3) build shared
libraries based on the code written (e.g, archives on Linux or DLLs on Windows), (4) document the work done in a software
manual, and (5) implement efficient versions of algorithms using parallel programming techniques (e.g, OpenMP and OpenACC).

## Software Manual Description and Template

One project students have been asked to do in Math 4610 is to create a software manual for the codes that are written by the
semester. The software manual project requires students include well written, concise descriptions of the algorithms and codes
developed throughout the course. Students can use github to easily create the software manual with a template (see the link
below) to create a consistent looking description. Students are encouraged to organize the software manual so that codes
written to solve a similar or the same problem should be located together (e.g, the Bisection method and Newton's method for
finding roots of a nonlinear function of a single variable). Students are asked to build all routines including routines to
compute errors, do basic linear algebra operations, and other basic routines that are needed in support of the main algorithms
presented in the course.

The links below will take you to a software manual template in in a Markdown file for use by students in Math 4610.
